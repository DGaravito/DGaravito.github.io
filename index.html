    <p class="MainDescription"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mn-garavito/" title="View my LinkedIn page"><img class="ProfileImage" src="assets/Me.jpeg"></a>Hello, I am David Garavito, a Interprofessional Polytrauma & Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation Research Fellow for the Department of Veterans Affairs!  I received my M.A. in Human Development from <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" class="cornell">Cornell University</a> in 2017, my J.D. from <a href="https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu" target="_blank" class="cornell">Cornell Law School</a> in 2020, and my Ph.D. in Human Development from <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" class="cornell">Cornell University</a> in 2021.  My graduate work was under Dr. Valerie Reyna in the <a href="https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/research/labs/lrdm/home" target="_blank" class="cornell">Laboratory for Rational Decision Making</a>.  My research interests primarily lie in cognitive theory and neuroscience, with my main focus on judgment and decision making in legal and public health contexts.  My research examines the perception of risks and decision making within various contexts (parole outcomes, sports, substance use, vaccination, etc.) and the cognitive and neural effects of concussive and sub-concussive injuries.  I also conduct research on memory across the lifespan to detext the prevalence of semantic false memories, and I am using advanced models and theory to detect the development and progression of possible neurodegenerative diseases in at-risk populations.  Currently, I am working under Dr. James Bjork at the Hunter Holmes VA Medical Center examining the influence of traumatic brain injuries and combat exposure on the long-term health (i.e., substance misuse and development of neurodegenerative diseases) of current and former military personnel.  As a graduate of Cornell Law School and a barred attorney in New York, my legal experience has provided me with the insight to write on legal and policy matters relating to criminal law, human development, race and socioeconomic status, and the application of psychology and neuroscience.  I have published articles in the Cornell Journal of Law & Public Policy and the American Criminal Law Review on such topics, and I am currently writing several manuscripts on contemporary issues in law and technology, specifically as they affect children and their development.  Lastly, I am a developer of python-based programs, the best example if which is <a href="https://github.com/DGaravito/TaskMaster" target="_blank" class="cornell">TaskMaster</a>, a free and open-source application that can run psychological tasks on Mac and Windows computers.
